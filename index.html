        Go tooling essentials

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Sep 25, 2016</span>

    

<p>New to the Go tools? Or do you want to expand your knowledge? This article is
about the flags for the Go tools everyone should know.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer: This article might be slightly biased. This is a collection of
flags I personally use and flags people around me having trouble finding references for.
If you have more ideas, ping me on <a href="https://twitter.com/rakyll">Twitter</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="go-build-x">$ go build -x</h3>

<p><code>-x</code> lists all the commands go build invokes.</p>

<p>If you are curious about the Go toolchain, or using a cross-C compiler and
wondering about flags passed to the external compiler, or suspicious about
a linker bug; use <code>-x</code> to see all the invocations.</p>

<pre><code>$ go build -x
WORK=/var/folders/00/1b8h8000h01000cxqpysvccm005d21/T/go-build600909754
mkdir -p $WORK/hello/perf/_obj/
mkdir -p $WORK/hello/perf/_obj/exe/
cd /Users/jbd/src/hello/perf
/Users/jbd/go/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64/compile -o $WORK/hello/perf.a -trimpath $WORK -p main -complete -buildid bbf8e880e7dd4114f42a7f57717f9ea5cc1dd18d -D _/Users/jbd/src/hello/perf -I $WORK -pack ./perf.go
cd .
/Users/jbd/go/pkg/tool/darwin_amd64/link -o $WORK/hello/perf/_obj/exe/a.out -L $WORK -extld=clang -buildmode=exe -buildid=bbf8e880e7dd4114f42a7f57717f9ea5cc1dd18d $WORK/hello/perf.a
mv $WORK/hello/perf/_obj/exe/a.out perf
</code></pre>

<h3 id="go-build-gcflags">$ go build -gcflags</h3>

<p>Used to pass flags to the Go compiler. <code>go tool compile -help</code> lists all
the flags that can be passed to the compiler.</p>

<p>For example, to disable compiler optimizations and inlining, you can use
the following the gcflags.</p>

<pre><code>$ go build -gcflags=&quot;-N -I&quot;
</code></pre>

<h3 id="go-test-v">$ go test -v</h3>

<p>It provides chatty output for the testing. It prints the test name,
its status (failed or passed), how much it took to run the test, any logs
from the test case, etc.</p>

<p>go test without the <code>-v</code> flag is highly quiet, I always use it with <code>-v</code> turned on.
Sample output:</p>

<pre><code>$ go test -v context
=== RUN   TestBackground
--- PASS: TestBackground (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestTODO
--- PASS: TestTODO (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestWithCancel
--- PASS: TestWithCancel (0.10s)
=== RUN   TestParentFinishesChild
--- PASS: TestParentFinishesChild (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestChildFinishesFirst
--- PASS: TestChildFinishesFirst (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestDeadline
--- PASS: TestDeadline (0.16s)
=== RUN   TestTimeout
--- PASS: TestTimeout (0.16s)
=== RUN   TestCanceledTimeout
--- PASS: TestCanceledTimeout (0.10s)
...
PASS
ok  	context	2.426s
</code></pre>

<h3 id="go-test-race">$ go test -race</h3>

<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/race-detector">Go&rsquo;s race detector</a> is available
from the Go tools via <code>-race</code>. go test also supports this flag and reports races.
Use this flag during development to detect the races.</p>

<h3 id="go-test-run">$ go test -run</h3>

<p>You can filter tests to run by regex and the <code>-run</code> flag. The following command
will only <a href="https://blog.golang.org/examples">test examples</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ go test -run=Example
</code></pre>

<h3 id="go-test-coverprofile">$ go test -coverprofile</h3>

<p>You can output a cover profile as you are testing a package, then use go tool to
visualize them on a browser.</p>

<pre><code>$ go test -coverprofile=c.out &amp;&amp; go tool cover -html=c.out
</code></pre>

<p>The command above will create a coverage profile and open the results page in
the browser. The visualized results will look like the page below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/context-coverage.png" alt="context coverage" /></p>

<h3 id="go-test-exec">$ go test -exec</h3>

<p>It is a lesser known feature in Go that you can intercept the tools with another
program by using the <code>-exec</code> flag. This flag allows you to delegate some work to an
external program from the Go tool.</p>

<p>A commonly required scenario for this flag is when you need more than just executing
the tests on the host machine. The Android builder for Go, uses <code>-exec</code> to push the
test binaries to an Android device by using <code>adb</code> and collects the results.
<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/misc/android/go_android_exec.go">Android exec program</a>
can be used as a reference.</p>

<h3 id="go-get-u">$ go get -u</h3>

<p>If you run go-get for a package that is already in your GOPATH, go-get
is not going to update the package to its latest version.
<code>-u</code> forces the tool to sync with the latest version of the repo.</p>

<p>If you are a library author, you might like to write your installation
instructions with a <code>-u</code> flag, e.g. the way <a href="https://github.com/golang/lint#installation">golint</a> does.</p>

<pre><code>$ go get -u github.com/golang/lint/golint
</code></pre>

<h3 id="go-get-d">$ go get -d</h3>

<p>If you just want to clone a repo to your GOPATH and skip the building
and installation phase, use <code>-d</code>. It downloads the package and stops
before trying to build or install it.</p>

<p>I often use it as a replacement for git clone for repos with vanity URLs,
because it clones the repo to its proper GOPATH.
For example,</p>

<pre><code>$ go get -d golang.org/x/oauth2/...
</code></pre>

<p>will clone the package to $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/ouath2. Given golang.org/x/oauth2 is a
vanity URL, go-getting the repo is useful rather than trying to figure out
where the actual repo is (go.googlesource.com/oauth2).</p>

<h3 id="go-get-t">$ go get -t</h3>

<p>If your package has additional dependencies for tests, <code>-t</code> will allow you to
download them during go-get.
If you don&rsquo;t pass <code>-t</code>, go get will only download the dependencies for your non-test code.</p>

<h3 id="go-list-f">$ go list -f</h3>

<p>Allows you to list Go packages with a custom format. It is highly useful
for writing bash scripts.</p>

<p>The following command will print the dependencies of the runtime package:</p>

<pre><code>go list -f '{{.Deps}}' runtime
[runtime/internal/atomic runtime/internal/sys unsafe]
</code></pre>

<p>More formatting ideas can be found at

        Examples coverage

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 8, 2016</span>

    <p>Go programming language provides many unique good features to <a href="https://blog.golang.org/examples">
write and maintain examples</a> for your packages backed by the testing tools.</p>

<p>As an addition to the test coverage and test coverage report, <code>go test</code>
also can provide coverage for testable examples.</p>

<p>Use the following commands in your package to use the
<code>-run</code> flag to only the match the example tests and view the results
in your browser.</p>

<pre><code>$ go test -v -run=Example -coverprofile=c.out &amp;&amp; go tool cover -html=c.out
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that the coverage is reported for Examples with an Output block.
Examples without an &ldquo;Output&rdquo; block will not be tested and reported.</p>

<p>Here is what the <a href="/att/example-coverage.html">coverage</a> looks like
for the strings package from the stdlib.</p>

<p>High example coverage is probably not a neccesary signal
and not all lines are supposed to be documented with an example
but it might give you an idea whether you are missing out a significant
non-obvious case that needs to be documented
more comphensively.</p>

      <a href="http://golang.rakyll.org/parallelize-test-tables/">
        Parallelize your table-driven tests
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 6, 2016</span>

    <p>With Go 1.7, testing package supports sub-tests that allows you to run
multiple smaller tests from a test case. Each sub test is reported
independently in the <code>go test</code> output. More information about these
recent additions can be found at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mpvl/advanced-testing-concepts-for-go-1-dot-7">Marcel van Lohuizen&rsquo;s recent talk</a>
from GolangUK 2016.</p>

<p>These additions to Go 1.7 enabled reporting and other testing.T
functionality for subtests. One of the biggest contributions of the
recent changes is to be able to use these features for table-driven tests.</p>

<p>The other important feature it enables is to be able to parallize the
subtests (where makes sense) by using (*testing.T).Parallize().</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
	tc := []struct {
		dur time.Duration
	}{
		{time.Second},
		{2 * time.Second},
		{3 * time.Second},
		{4 * time.Second},
	}
	for _, tt := range tc {
		tt := tt
		t.Run(&quot;&quot;, func(st *testing.T) {
			st.Parallel()
			time.Sleep(tt.dur)
		})
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The test suite above will run roughly in 4 seconds rather than 10 seconds.
TestFoo#01, TestFoo#02, TestFoo#03 and TestFoo#04 will begin at the same
time, will wait for <code>tt.dur</code> and be completed.</p>

<pre><code>$ go test -v
=== RUN   TestFoo
=== RUN   TestFoo/#00
=== RUN   TestFoo/#01
=== RUN   TestFoo/#02
=== RUN   TestFoo/#03
--- PASS: TestFoo (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestFoo/#00 (1.00s)
    --- PASS: TestFoo/#01 (2.00s)
    --- PASS: TestFoo/#02 (3.00s)
    --- PASS: TestFoo/#03 (4.00s)
PASS
ok  	hello/subtests	4.020s
</code></pre>

<p>If you have table driven that are free from races and are majorly blocked
by anything other than your CPU, consider parallelizing them with the new sub tests.</p>

      <a href="http://golang.rakyll.org/instruments/">
        Using Instruments to profile Go programs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 2, 2016</span>

    <p>Apple has a suite of instrumentation and tracing tools for performance
analysis avaiable as a part of their Xcode tooling set. In this article,
we will use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/">Instruments</a>
to record and analyze the CPU profile of a Go program.</p>

<p>Instruments also provide a large set of macOS-specific tracing and profiling
if you have performance issues specifically on darwin.</p>

<p>Some of these specific profiles are:</p>

<ul>
<li>System trace: Collects comprehensive information about system calls,
scheduling, user-kernel space transitions. (Available only on OSX.)</li>
<li>System usage: Gives very detailed output about I/O system activity.
(Available only on iOS.)</li>
<li>File Activity: Monitors file and directory activity such as open/close,
permission modifications, creation, copying and moving.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instruments provide a rich and very easy to use UI to display profiles.
I highly recommend it as an addition to existing profiler UIs and vizualizers.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s profile a Go program.</p>

<p>Launch the Instruments app and select &ldquo;Time Profiler&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Create a target with your Go binary and arguments and env variables
you want to start the binary with. In this tutorial, I will use the
following program.</p>

<pre><code>go get -u github.com/rakyll/hey
</code></pre>

<p>We will use <code>hey</code> to make 10000 requests with 200 goroutines
to the target provided in the arguments.</p>

<p>The target I have for <code>hey</code> looks like what&rsquo;s below.</p>

<p><img src="/img/instruments-target.png" alt="Instruments target" /></p>

<p>Once you have a target, you can click on the record button to start
recording samples. Once enough samples are collected, stop or it will
eventually stop when the program finishes.</p>

<p><img src="/img/instruments-results.png" alt="Instruments results" /></p>

<p>You can filter by symbol name, user vs kernel callstacks, time span,
physical or logical CPU and more. You can also double click any of the symbols listed
to jump to the source code.</p>

<p>Please note that Go programs cannot work with every profile available
on Instruments. But there are a few profiles that absolutely can improve
your profiling experience. With stack frame pointers enabled by default in Go 1.7,
it became easier for tools like Instruments to capture backtraces more efficiently.</p>

<p>Happy profiling!</p>

      <a href="http://golang.rakyll.org/grpc-streaming/">
        Bidirectional gRPC streaming for Go
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 30, 2016</span>

    <p><em>Disclaimer: This article is not about a core Go package or tool but <a href="http://www.grpc.io/">gRPC</a>.</em></p>

<p>gRPC provides support for implementing streaming endpoints as well as
streaming support in their clients. Bidirectional streaming is useful
if you want both server and client to be able to communicate
to the other side independently in a full duplex fashion.</p>

<p>In this article, I will dig into how to use the streaming gRPC
Go client to talk to a streaming API endpoint.</p>

<p>I am not expecting the readers to implement a server, hence I will use an
existing service.
Google has recently realeased the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech/">Cloud Speech API</a>
which allows its users
to caption their audio input. Speech API also supports a bidirectional
streaming endpoint where you can sent audio data continously as you are
waiting on more responses from the server on another incoming channel.</p>

<p>Initialize a client:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">stream, err := speech.NewSpeechClient(conn).StreamingRecognize(ctx)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We want to pipe the stdin to the API as we are printing the results.
Therefore, we will need two goroutines, one sending audio data to the
service and another retrieving the results.</p>

<p>The program will read from os.Stdin into an intermediate buffer and
will immediately push the buffer to the service.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">go func() {
    // pipe stdin to the API
    buf := make([]byte, 1024)
    for {
        n, err := os.Stdin.Read(buf)
        if err == io.EOF {
            return // nothing else to pipe, kill this goroutine
        }
        if err != nil {
            // TODO: handle the error
            continue 
        }
        if err = stream.Send(&amp;speech.StreamingRecognizeRequest{
            StreamingRequest: &amp;speech.StreamingRecognizeRequest_AudioContent{
                AudioContent: buf[:n],
            },
        }); err != nil {
            // TODO: handle the error
        }
    }
}()
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time, the program will start reading the responses in the
main goroutine and print the captions as service pushes them:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">for {
    resp, err := stream.Recv()
    if err == io.EOF {
        break
    }
    if err != nil {
        // TODO: handle the error
        continue
    }
    if resp.Error != nil {
        // TODO: handle the error
        continue
    }
    for _, result := range resp.Results {
        fmt.Printf(&quot;result: %+v\n&quot;, result)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The full reference is living in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/rakyll/e7082fdcbdb18ee32997aa602ca164d6">gist</a>
where you can learn more about the initializing of the gRPC connection and more.</p>

<p>Please note that the same pattern of sending and receiving can be applied to
work with any gRPC bidirectional streaming client.</p>

      <a href="http://golang.rakyll.org/eg/">
        eg to apply transformations to Go code
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 27, 2016</span>

    <p>If you are willing to make large scale refactoring in your
Go programs, automating the refactoring tasks is more desirable than
manual editing. <code>eg</code> is a program that allows you to perform transformations
based on template Go files.</p>

<p>To install the tool, run the following:</p>

<pre><code>$ go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/eg
</code></pre>

<p><code>eg</code> requires a template file to look for which transformation it should
apply to your source code. What&rsquo;s nice is that the template file is a Go file
with little annotations.</p>

<p>Consider the following Go program:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">$ cat $GOPATH/src/hello/hello.go
package hello

import &quot;time&quot;

// ExtendWith50000ns adds 50000ns to t.
func ExtendWith50000ns(t time.Time) time.Time {
	return t.Add(time.Duration(50000))
}
</code></pre>

<p>Assume you want to eliminate the unnecessary time.Duration casting at ExtendWith50000ns
and as a good practice, you would also like to add a unit to the duration rather than
just passing 50000.</p>

<p><code>eg</code> requires a template file where you define before and afters that represents the
transformation.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">$ cat T.template
package template

import (
    &quot;time&quot;
)

func before(t time.Time, d time.Duration) time.Time {
    // if already time.Duration, do not cast.
    return t.Add(time.Duration(d))
}

func after(t time.Time, d time.Duration) time.Time  {
    return t.Add(d * time.Nanosecond)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And run the <code>eg</code> command on your hello package to apply it at every occurrence of this pattern.</p>

<pre><code>$ eg -w -t T.template hello
=== /Users/jbd/src/hello/hello.go (1 matches)
</code></pre>

<p>Voila!</p>

<p>The file now contains a duration that is not casted unnecessarily and it has a unit.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">$ cat $GOPATH/src/hello/hello.go
package hello

import &quot;time&quot;

// ExtendWith50000ns adds 50000ns to t.
func ExtendWith50000ns(t time.Time) time.Time {
	return t.Add(50000 * time.Nanosecond)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: There are many <a href="https://github.com/golang/tools/tree/master/refactor/eg/testdata">.template files</a>
underneath the package for testing purposes but they can also be used as a
reference how to write other transformation templates.</p>
